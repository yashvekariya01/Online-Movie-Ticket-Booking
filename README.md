# Movie Ticket Booking System (Asp.Net)


This project basically manages the ticket booking process of a cinema, providing an interface to the user to book movie tickets in an easier way.

This project proceeds through a sequence of well-designed forms provided with validations to ensure consistency, reliability and most importantly correctness of information fed into the database.

This is a system in which user can book tickets for his favourite movie he wants to watch in the big theatre screens.

Complete code files are already in this repository with database backup(OMTBS.bak)
